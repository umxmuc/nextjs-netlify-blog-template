## What strategy to follow if I don't know?

If you are at a blank, then learn one of the most important basic games.

Writing, Copywriting, Public Speaking, Selling in Person.

If you master one of these, you can combine it with any subject specific game.

## The most important tip ever

\--- comes from Scott Adams, the inventor of the Dilbert comics.

The tip is to combine skills.

The reasoning is as simple as it is stunning.

If you try to excel in one skill (e.g. Tennis) odds are extremly low and the effort ist extremly high.

Only the top 1% make it and they literally have to dedicate there lives to it. No more fun times, no more socializing at high school parties - No, Tennis must be your LIFE from the wee hours in the morning up to the late night.

And then still chances are meager that you make it.

But if you combine skills cleverly, your odds for success are much higher AND your effort can be lower.

Imagine being within the top 25% tennis players AND the top 25% of YouTubers.

You go start your YouTube channel on how to play Tennis.

You will make a killing. Still having time to follow anything you love, beyond Tennis and YouTubing.

By combining to skills you build a segment.
